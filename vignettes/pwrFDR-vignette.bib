  Abstract = {{The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling
     the familywise error rate (FWER).  This approach, though, has faults,
     and we point out a few.  A different approach to problems of multiple
     significance testing is presented.  It calls for controlling the
     expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses - the false discovery
     rate.  This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
     true but is smaller otherwise.  Therefore, in problems where the control
     of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
     there is potential for a gain in power.  A simple sequential
     Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate
     for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the
     gain in power is substantial.  The use of the new procedure and the
     appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}},

Journal = {{Ann Stat}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1165-1188}},
Abstract = {{Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the
   appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing
   problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling
   procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more
   powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional family
   wise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the
   false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression
   dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null
   hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to
   cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of
   many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test
   statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t.
   Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested
   hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other
   forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure
   controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which
   a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.}},

Abstract = {{The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) procedure enjoys
   widespread use in multiple testing scenarios when the cost of false
   positives is low and the number of simultaneous tests prohibits use of
   the Bonferroni procedure. The FDR and the average power are each
   expected values, of the false discovery proportion (FDP) and true
   positive proportion (TPP), respectively. Chi (2007), proved a law of the
   iterated logarithm (LIL) for the positive proportion (PP), FDP and TPP,
   and discusses a criticality phenomenon whereby a minimal FDR
   corresponding to the effect size is required for a nonzero rate of
   positive calls. While almost sure convergence follows as a corollary, no
   direct simple proof exists in the literature. We provide this result
   under the same set of conditions. Of greater consequence, we prove
   central limit results (CLT) for the PP, FPF and TPP under these weak
   conditions, providing full characterization of the limits. Published by

Journal = {{Bioinformatics}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{739-746}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: Sample size calculation is important in experimental design
   and is even more so in microarray or proteomic experiments since only a
   few repetitions can be afforded. In the multiple testing problems
   involving these experiments, it is more powerful and more reasonable to
   control false discovery rate (FDR) or positive FDR (pFDR) instead of
   type I error, e.g. family-wise error rate (FWER). When controlling FDR,
   the traditional approach of estimating sample size by controlling type I
   error is no longer applicable.
   Results: Our proposed method applies to controlling FDR. The sample size
   calculation is straightforward and requires minimal computation, as
   illustrated with two sample t-tests and F-tests. Based on simulation
   with the resultant sample size, the power is shown to be achievable by
   the q-value procedure.}},

   Volume = {{34}},
   Number = {{4}},
   Pages = {{1850-1873}},
   Abstract = {{Consider the multiple testing problem of testing null hypotheses
      H-1,..., H-S. A classical approach to dealing with the multiplicity
      problem is to restrict attention to procedures that control the
      familywise error rate (FWER), the probability of even one false
      rejection. But if s is large, control of the FWER is so stringent that
      the ability of a procedure that controls the FWER to detect false null
      hypotheses is limited. It is therefore desirable to consider other
      measures of error control. This article considers two generalizations of
      the FIVER. The first is the k-FWER, in which one is willing to tolerate
      k or more false rejections for some fixed k >= 1. The second is based on
      the false discovery proportion (FDP), defined to be the number of false
      rejections divided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be
      0 if there are no rejections). Benjamini and Hochberg {[}J. Roy.
      Statist. Soc. Ser B 57 (1995) 289-300] proposed control of the false
      discovery rate (FDR), by which they meant that, for fixed alpha, E(FDP)
      <= alpha. Here, we consider control of the FDP in the sense that, for
      fixed gamma and alpha, P \{FDP > gamma\} <= alpha. Beginning with any
      nondecreasing sequence of constants and p-values for the individual
      tests, we derive stepup procedures that control each of these two
      measures of error control without imposing any assumptions on the
      dependence structure of the p-values. We use our results to point out a
      few interesting connections with some closely related stepdown
      procedures. We then compare and contrast two FDP-controlling procedures
      obtained using our results with the stepup procedure for control of the
      FDR of Benjamini and Yekutieli.}},

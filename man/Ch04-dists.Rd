  The Distribution family object
}
\description{
  The \code{pwrFDR} package currently incorporates 3 distribution types,
  normal, t and F. The first two of these are strictly for statistics formed 
  from two group comparison while the third is for statistics formed from the 
  omnibus test of any difference among an arbitrary number of groups >=2. The
  structure is general and user expandable. One must specify the density, 
  CDF and quantile function for a given distribution and its parameters under
  the null and under the alternative. These parameters must be expressions
  to be evaluated inside the kernel of the power program, functions of the
  arguments \code{n.sample}, \code{groups} and \code{effect.size}. This is 
  not used directly by the user at all unless she (he) wants to add a 
  distribution type.

  A data frame with 3 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{pars0}}{a list vector having components 'c(nd, p1, p2, ...)'
                        where 'nd' is the distribution number starting with 0,
                        and p1, p2, ..., are paramters of the distribution,
                        which are functions of 'n.sample', 'groups' and

                        'pars0' are the parameters under the null.}

\details{
   \code{dists} is a data.frame with components \code{pars0}, \code{pars1}, 
   \code{minv}, \code{ddist}, \code{pdist}, \code{qdist} and \code{rdist}. 
   For the three available distribution options, "normal", "t" and "f",
   the components \code{pars0} and \code{pars1} take the following form:\cr

\tabular{ll}{
1. pars0                              \tab  pars1                                    \cr
2. c(0,ncp=0,sd=1)                    \tab  c(0,ncp=.NCP.,sd=1)                      \cr
3. c(1,ncp=0,ndf=.DF.)                \tab  c(1,ncp=.NCP.,ndf=.DF.)                  \cr
4. c(2,ncp=0,ndf1=groups-1,ndf2=.DF.) \tab  c(2,ncp=.NCP.^2,ndf1=groups-1,ndf2=.DF.) \cr}
The component \code{minv} gives the minumum value of the support set of the
distribution. For the above named three available distribution options,
\code{minv} is set to the values -Inf, -Inf and 0, respectively. The components
\code{ddist}, \code{pdist}, \code{qdist}, and \code{rdist} contain functions
defining the density, CDF, quantile, and simulator function, respectively. For
the above named three available distribution options, \code{ddist} takes
the following form:\cr
\tabular{l}{
1. ddist                                                             \cr
2. function (x, par) dnorm(x, mean = par[2], sd = par[3])            \cr
3. function (x, par) dt(x, ncp = par[2], df = par[3])                \cr
4. function (x, par) df(x, ncp = par[2], df1 = par[3], df2 = par[4]) \cr
exept for rdist, which has arguments 'n' and 'par'\cr}

The components \code{pdist} and \code{qdist} are nearly identical to the
component \code{ddist}, but with pnorm, pt, pf and qnorm, qt, qf replacing
dnorm, dt and df, respectively.\cr
The variables, \code{.NCP.} and \code{.DF.} named above are defined within the
functions in which \code{ddist} is used based upon corresponding expressions,
\code{NCP} and \code{DF}. These expressions currently contain 3 component
expressions, one for each of the available test types, "paired", "balanced"
and "unbalanced".\cr
\code{NCP} is currently defined:\cr
\tabular{l}{
1. NCP                                                                  \cr
expression(n.sample^0.5*effect.size,(n.sample/groups)^0.5*effect.size,  \cr
   ((n.sample-1)/(1+sum((n.sample-1)/(nii.sample-1))))^0.5*effect.size) \cr}
and \code{DF} is currently defined:\cr
\tabular{l}{
1. DF                                                                   \cr
expression(n.sample - 1, groups * (n.sample - 1),                       \cr
           groups^2*(n.sample-1)/(1+sum((n.sample-1)/(nii.sample-1))))	\cr}

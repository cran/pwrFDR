\title{
  Evaluate \code{pwrFDR} on a grid.
}
\description{
  Function for evaluating \code{pwrFDR} on a factorial design of
  possible parameters.
}
\usage{
  pwrFDR.grid(effect.size, n.sample, r.1, alpha, delta, groups, N.tests,
              average.power, tp.power, lambda, type, grpj.per.grp1,
              FDP.control.method, control)
}
\arguments{
  \item{effect.size}{
    A vector of effect sizes to be looped over. The effect size
    (mean over standard deviation) for test statistics having non-zero
    means. Assumed to be a constant (in magnitude) over non-zero mean
    test statistics.
  }
  \item{n.sample}{
    A vector of sample sizes to be looped over. The sample size is the
    number of experimental replicates. Required for calculation of power
  }
  \item{r.1}{
    A vector of mixing proportions to be looped over. The mixing
    proportion is the proportion of simultaneous tests that are
    non-centrally located 
  }
  \item{alpha}{
    The false discovery rate (in the BH case) or the upper bound on the
    probability that the FDP exceeds delta (BHCLT and Romano case)
  }
  \item{delta}{
    If the "FDP.control.method" is set to 'Romano' or 'BHCLT', then this
    optional argument can be set to the exceedance thresh-hold in
    defining the FDP-tp: \eqn{P\{ FDP > \delta \} < \alpha}. The default
    value is \eqn{\alpha}.
  }
  \item{groups}{
    The number of experimental groups to compare. Must be integral and
    >=1. The default value is 2.
  }
  \item{N.tests}{
    The number of simultaneous hypothesis tests. 
  }
  \item{average.power}{
    The desired average power. Calculation of sample size, effect size
    mixing proportion or alpha requires specification of either
    'average.power' or 'tp.power'.
  }
  \item{tp.power}{
    The desired tp-power (see \code{\link{pwrFDR}} documentation).
    Calculation of sample size, effect size mixing proportion or alpha
    requires specification of either 'average.power' or 'tp.power'.
  }
  \item{lambda}{
    The tp-power threshold, required when calculating the tp-power
    (see \code{\link{pwrFDR}} documentation) or when calculating the
    sample size, effect size mixing proportion or alpha required for
    tp-power.
  }
  \item{type}{
    A character string specifying, in the groups=2 case, whether the
    test is 'paired', 'balanced', or 'unbalanced' and in the case when
    groups >=3, whether the test is 'balanced' or 'unbalanced'. The
    default in all cases is 'balanced'. Left unspecified in the one
    sample (groups=1) case. 
  }
  \item{grpj.per.grp1}{
    Required when \code{type}="unbalanced", specifies the group 0 to
    group 1 ratio in the two group case, and in the case of 3 or more
    groups, the group j to group 1 ratio, where group 1 is the group
    with the largest effect under the alternative hypothesis. 
  }
  \item{FDP.control.method}{
    A character string specifying how the false discovery proportion (FDP) is to be
    controlled. You may specify the whole word or any shortened uniquely
    identifying truncation. \cr
     "BHFDR": the usual BH-FDR \cr
     "BHCLT": use asymptotic approximation to the distribution of the FDP 
              to find a smaller FDR which guarantees probability less
              than alpha that the FDP exceeds alpha. \cr
    "Romano": use Romano's method which guarantees probability less than 
              alpha that the FDP exceeds alpha. \cr
      "Auto": in 'FixedPoint' mode, the program will use its own 
              wisdom to determine which choice above to make. The 
              order of conservatism is Romano > BHCLT > BHFDR, but 
              BHFDR offers only expected control while the other two 
              guarantee bounds on the excedance probabilty. If the 
	      distribution of the FDP is nearly degenerate, then BHFDR 
	      is the best option. Otherwise, if it can be reliably used, 
              BHCLT would be the best choice. The 'effective' denominator, 
	      gamma*N.tests, in the CLT determines when the approximation 
	      is good enough and the asymptotic standard error of the FDP 
	      determines when the distribution is dispersed enough to matter.
              Use "Auto" to run through these checks and determine the best. 
              A return argument, 'Auto', displays the choice made. See 
              output components and details. \cr
      "both": in 'simulation' mode, compute statistics R and T under BHCLT
              and Romano (in addition to BHFDR). Corresponding
	      statistics are denoted R.st, T.st corresponding to BHCLT
	      control of the FDP, and R.R and T.R corresponding to
	      Romano control of the FDP. If sim.level is set to 2,
	      (default) the statistics R.st.ht and T.st.ht, which are
	      the number rejected and number true positives under BHCLT
	      where r_0 = 1-r_1, gamma, and alpha.star have been estimated 
	      from the P-value data and then alpha.star computed from
              these.
  }
  \item{control}{Optionally, a list with components with the following  
                 components: \cr
           'tol' is a convergence criterion used in iterative 
   	         methods which is set to 1e-8 by default.
	   'max.iter' is an iteration limit, set to 20 for the iterated
	         function limit and 1000 for all others by default.
	   'distop', specifying the distribution family of the central
	         and non-centrally located sub-populations. distopt=1
		 gives normal (2 groups), distop=2 gives t- (2 groups)
		 and distopt=3 gives F- (2+ groups) \cr
	   'CS', correlation structure, for use only with 'method="simulation"'  
	         which will simulate m simulatenous tests with correlations 
                 'rho' in blocks of size 'n.WC'. Specify as a list
		 CS = list(rho=0.80,n.WC=50) for example.  \cr
	   'sim.level' sim level 2 (default) stipulates, when FDP.control.method
	         is set to "BHCLT", or "both", R.st.ht and T.st.ht are
	         computed in addition to R.st and T.st (see above). \cr
           'low.power.stop' in simulation option, will result in an error message 
   	         if the power computed via FixedPoint method is too low, which 
	         result in no solution for the BHCLT option. Default setting is TRUE. 
	         Set to FALSE to over-ride this behavior. \cr
           'FDP.meth.thresh' fine-tunes the 'Auto' voodoo (see above). Leave 
	         this alone. \cr
	   'verb' vebosity level.\cr
	   'ast.le.a' leaving this at the default value TRUE forces
	         'alpha.star', the solution under FDP.method.control="BHCLT",
		 to be less than the specified 'alpha'.
